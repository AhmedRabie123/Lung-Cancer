        <p class="para-medication">The first step is to consult with a healthcare professional, such as a primary
            care physician or an oncologist, who can guide the patient through the diagnosis and treatment process. The
            healthcare professional may recommend several tests, such as a CT scan, biopsy, or blood tests, to determine the
            extent and type of lung cancer.</p>
    </h5>
    <h5 class="head2-medication text-center">
        <p class="para-medication">Based on the results of these tests, the healthcare professional may recommend one or more
            treatment options, such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these. The treatment
            plan will depend on several factors, such as the stage and type of lung cancer, your overall health and medical
            history, and the preferences of you and goals for treatment.</p>
